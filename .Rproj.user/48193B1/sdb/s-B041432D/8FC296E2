As more data becomes available to tackle these complex pathways, researchers and policy makers need novel tools to collect, store, analyze, and interact with this multidisciplinary data. EcoHealth Alliance is working creatively across disciplines to harness these new data challenges to prepare for the next disease threat.\"\n\nKarissa Whiting is a research assistant for the EcoHealth Alliance Data Science and Technology team, where she applies her background in biostatistics and qualitative research to understand and assess gaps in surveillance, and plan tools and technologies to bridge these gaps with the goal of minimizing delay between disease emergence and detection.\n\nKarissa received her BA in Anthropology from New York University in 2013 where she studied Medical Anthropology and a biocultural approach to understanding disease experience and treatment. Her work there sparked an interest in research that uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, and in harnessing data to solve complex, interdisciplinary problems.\n\nAt EcoHealth Alliance, Karissa’s work focuses on the assessment and application of digital tools to detect and analyze emerging infectious disease threats before they reach epidemic levels, particularly by finding structured information in nontraditional data sources like news feeds. Karissa works on design, development, testing, and validation of the Data Science and Technology team’s software projects, as well as conducting research to inform the team’s work.\n\nTo engage with the increasingly complex ecosystem of tools and analytic methods available to tackle this work, she is currently pursuing an M.S. in Biostatistics at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nKarissa Whiting has also contributed to the USAID PREDICT behavioral research team and modeling and analytics team.\n\nI received a BA in mathematics from Dickinson College in 2007 and a PhD in Biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University in 2012. My dissertation was advised by Ciprian Crainiceanu and Brian Caffo, and focused on statistical methods for high-dimensional structured data. I joined Columbia as an assistant professor in 2012.\n\nMy statistical research is generally focused on functional data analysis, and draws heavily from ongoing collaborations with researchers in other disciplines. One major emphasis is the use of motion kinematics to understand motor control, skill learning, and recovery following stroke; another is physical activity measurement and quantification using wearable devices. The research page has more information on recent projects.\n\nIn 2013, I founded (with Todd Ogden and Phil Reiss) the Functional Data Analysis Working Group (FDAWG) at Columbia Biostat.\n\n\n\n",
